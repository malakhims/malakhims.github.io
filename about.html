    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    
    <p> Salutations! I am Tamya J and I run the project ophanimkei under the pseudonym Malaika. My work consists artwork, games, zines, and website. I was a Computing Student for three years then switched to Digital Media as I spoke to more design interests and realized it matched my skills and hobbies more than a CS degree. </p>

    <p>Despite spending a significant amount of time pursuing CS, I have no regrets as I feel as though it has benefitted my artistic skills an assortment of ways. Logic is an important skill when it comes to design making you see, and so many digital mediums require programmming!</p>
